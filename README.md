# BasicCPUDesign
 
 Design practice to implement a 5-Stage Pipelined RISC-V CPU. 
 
 Will impplement the following instructions:
   - LUI
   - JAL
   - BEQ
   - ADD
   - LW
   - SW
   - WFI (not yet)
   
   with some strategies to reduce stall cycles due to data dependencies
   
   bla-bla-bla
   
   A majority part of code is shamelessly copied from 《自己动手写cpu》
